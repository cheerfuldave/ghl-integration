1. **Environment Variable Configuration**: The class retrieves the OpenAI API key from the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
2. **OpenAI Assistant Initialization**: The class initializes an OpenAI assistant instance using the provided API key.
3. **Message Processing**: The `processMessage` method sends the user message to OpenAI for a response and also interacts with the GHL platform to generate a GHL response.
4. **Error Handling**: The class includes robust error handling for missing environment variables and API errors.
5. **sendToGHL Method**: This method is responsible for sending data to the GHL platform and is mocked during testing.

Here is a summary of the key implementation requirements and functionality described in the document:

## Integration Requirements
1. **OpenAI API Key**: The `GHLIntegration` class requires the OpenAI API key to be set as an environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`).
2. **OpenAI Assistant Initialization**: The class initializes an OpenAI assistant instance using the provided API key.
3. **GHL Platform Integration**: The class includes a `sendToGHL` method to interact with the GHL platform, which is mocked during testing.

## Functionality
1. **Message Processing**: The `processMessage` method takes a user message, sends it to OpenAI for a response, and also interacts with the GHL platform to generate a GHL response.
2. **Response Handling**: The method returns an object containing both the AI response and the GHL response.
3. **Error Handling**: The class includes robust error handling for missing environment variables and API errors.

## Testing
The implementation is tested using Jest with the following test cases:
1. **Successful Message Processing**: Verifies that the class processes a message and returns both AI and GHL responses.
2. **Error Handling**: Ensures that the class handles API errors gracefully.

## Summary
The `GHLIntegration` class is a robust solution for integrating GHL and OpenAI functionalities. It handles the necessary configuration, API usage, and response processing, providing a unified interface for interacting with both platforms.
